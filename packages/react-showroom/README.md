# React Showroom

[https://react-showroom.js.org/](https://react-showroom.js.org/)

Document React components by declaring props definition and writing markdown.

```bash
npm i -D react-showroom
```

## Key Features

- Auto generate documentations for your component props from the component's TypeScript definition.
- Write markdown to show examples to use the component, which will become an editable playground.
- Auto generated props control/knobs based on component props type definitions.
- Supported languages for live examples: typescript (TSX and TS), javascript (JSX and JS), and HTML.
- Improve collaborations: edit code/add comments on specific examples with shareable URL without any backend.
- Ensure the components are SSR-friendly - the site can be pre-render on build time.
