# React Showroom

Document React components by declaring props definition and writing markdown.

```bash inlineBlock
npm i react-showroom
```

## Features

- Auto generate documentations for your component props from the component's TypeScript definition.
- Write markdown to show examples (in JSX or TSX) to use the component, which will become an editable playground.
- Ensure the components are SSR-friendly - the examples can be pre-render on build time.
