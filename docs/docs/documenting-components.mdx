# Documenting Components

React Showroom generates documentations for your components based on type definition of your components, the comments on the type definitions, and markdown file.

## Documenting Component Props

Declare your component props as usual in TypeScript:

<DocumentingComponentPropsSource />

And the following will be generated:

<DocumentingComponentPropsResult />

## Comments for Component and Props

To provide more descriptions to the props and the comment itself, you can add JSDoc style comments.

<DocumentingComponentCommentsSource />

And the documentations will be reflected.

<DocumentingComponentCommentsResult />

JSDoc tags will be parsed and displayed as well.

<DeprecatedExampleSource />

will results in

<DeprecatedExampleResult />

## Show Usages with Markdown

To show usage examples for the component, create a `.mdx` file next to the component with the same name as the component file.

<MarkdownSource />

will produces the following output.

<MarkdownResult />

Few things to take note:

- You must tag the code block with `tsx` or `jsx` for it to become live example.
- If the last expression in your code block is a JSX, that will be the displayed result of the example.
- The component is automatically injected into the scope, so you doesn't need to import it.
- `React` is automatically injected into the scope as well, but it's fine if you want to import it.

A few scenarios for code blocks:

<AnotherMarkdownSource />

And their results:

<AnotherMarkdownResult />
