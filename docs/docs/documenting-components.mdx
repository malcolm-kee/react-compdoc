# Documenting Components

React Showroom generates documentations for your components based on type definition of your components, the comments on the type definitions, and markdown file.

## Documenting Component Props

Declare your component props as usual in TypeScript:

<DocumentingComponentPropsSource />

And the following will be generated:

<DocumentingComponentPropsResult />

## Comments for Component and Props

To provide more descriptions to the props and the comment itself, you can add JSDoc style comments.

<DocumentingComponentCommentsSource />

And the documentations will be reflected.

<DocumentingComponentCommentsResult />

JSDoc tags will be parsed and displayed as well.

<DeprecatedExampleSource />

will results in

<DeprecatedExampleResult />

## Show Usages with Markdown

To show usage examples for the component, create a `.mdx` file next to the component with the same name as the component file.

<MarkdownSource />

will produces the following output.

<MarkdownResult />

<span className="block md:hidden">
  Open the hamburget menu and choose view as Designer to see the technical
  details hidden.
</span>

<span className="hidden md:block">
  Click the toggle Switch on the Sidebar to see the technical details hidden.
</span>

This is handy for non-technical audience (designer/business) to view the site.

Few things to take note:

1. You must tag the code block with `tsx` or `jsx` for it to become live example.
1. If the last expression in your code block is a JSX, that will be the displayed result of the example.
1. The component is automatically injected into the scope, so you doesn't need to import it.
1. `React` is automatically injected into the scope as well, but it's fine if you want to import it.

A few scenarios for code blocks:

<AnotherMarkdownSource />

And the result:

<AnotherMarkdownResult />

## Show Different Variants

A common use case is to show different variants of the component side-by-side so they can be compared visually.

You can, of course, render the component by passing different props to it in an example to do that.

However, you need to maintain the example so any changes to the props will be reflected in the example.

Another options is to use the `useUnionProps` custom hook (available in `react-showroom/client`), which provide the variants (parsed from the props type definition) as options to your examples.

<UnionPropsSource />

<UnionPropsResult />

## Collaboration Tips

React Showroom is developed with helping collaborations in mind, and the following are some tips to use it effectively.

### Use Standalone View to Share Particular Example/Snapshot

All examples will generates a standalone view (which can be opened with the "Standalone" button at bottom right).

```jsx frame live initialHeight=68
<div>
  <h1 className="text-3xl font-extrabold">I am an example</h1>
  <p>Click the Standalone button at bottom right.</p>
</div>
```

1. The standalone view has its own URL that you can share with others.
1. In the standalone view, you can update the code or update the props (for [Component Playground](/getting-started/component-playground)) and those changes will be persisted in the URL.
1. You can also add comment on particular point of the example, and those will be persisted in the URL as well. For example, try open this <a href="/getting-started/documenting-components/_standalone/0336e30d0e28a49a31427f3cd9d8f877?commentMode=true&comments=NobwRALgpgHhYC4wBUAWBLAzgAmnbANgPZEDWOA5gE5QCGEAhGADRgBeJAtgDJQBuUAojAB2AKwswGACbSoAOwDK6NlEyJgAXVYEoAM3gIALAE4AHKwhEADogBsZgHQAGAIxi7AJjGtMqIgDuAGJUtJxQiBBUAK5QrOjSws4AzMl2UMnO0s5Qnma0prTJrkaeInrJAMbSJtJmemYiIgC0rnZGzibeJilGdi3OYAC%2BmkA" className="text-green-600 hover:underline">link</a>.

### Use the Accessibility Check Result to Discuss Accessibility Issues

The accessibility check result (powered by [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core)) is a good starting point to discuss about accessibility issues of your components/designs.

You can highlight the elements in the example by checking the "Highlight" checkbox.
