# Documenting Components

React Showroom generates documentations for your components based on type definition of your components, the comments on the type definitions, and markdown file.

## Documenting Component Props

Declare your component props as usual in TypeScript:

<DocumentingComponentPropsSource />

And the following will be generated:

<DocumentingComponentPropsResult />

## Comments for Component and Props

To provide more descriptions to the props and the comment itself, you can add JSDoc style comments.

<DocumentingComponentCommentsSource />

And the documentations will be reflected.

<DocumentingComponentCommentsResult />

JSDoc tags will be parsed and displayed as well.

<DeprecatedExampleSource />

will results in

<DeprecatedExampleResult />

## Show Usages with Markdown

To show usage examples for the component, create a `.mdx` file next to the component with the same name as the component file.

<MarkdownSource />

will produces the following output.

<MarkdownResult />

Few things to take note:

1. You must tag the code block with `tsx` or `jsx` for it to become live example.
1. If the last expression in your code block is a JSX, that will be the displayed result of the example.
1. The component is automatically injected into the scope, so you doesn't need to import it. However, this is not true if you use `frame`. You need to add the [`imports` configuration](/api/configuration#imports) for the component to be available in the example.
1. `React` is automatically injected into the scope as well, but it's fine if you want to import it.
1. Examples with `frame` are not being SSR, and they cause layout shift (which is probably not a big deal). I have some idea how to support them, hopefully have time to work on them sometimes soon.

Handy features for collaborations:

1. If you click the "Standalone" button to open the standalone view, a page with only the particular example will be displayed. This allows you to share the URL to others and they can open the specific example using the URL.
1. If you edit the code example in standalone view, the change will be encoded in the URL as well. You can use that to tweak the example and share the changes.

A few scenarios for code blocks:

And the result:

<AnotherMarkdownResult />
