# Component Playground

By using `usePropsEditor` custom hook and `PropsEditor` component (available at `react-showroom/client`) in your example, you can create a playground for your components (similar to Storybook's [Controls](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/essentials/controls)).

Compared to using Storybook, you do not need to manually configure the controls because we extract the props from your props definition.

## Simple Example

<PlaygroundSource />

<PlaygroundResult />

## Overwriting Initial Props

By passing `initialProps` options to `usePropsEditor`, you can overwrite the initial values for props in the playground.

<PlaygroundSource2 />

<PlaygroundResult2 />
