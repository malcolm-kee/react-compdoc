# Component Playground

By using `usePropsEditor` custom hook and `PropsEditor` component (available at `react-showroom/client`) in your example, you can create a playground for your components (similar to Storybook's [Controls/Knobs](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/essentials/controls)).

Compared to using Storybook, you don't have to manually configure the controls because we extract the props from your props definition and provide sensible default controls.

## Simple Example

<PlaygroundSource />

<PlaygroundResult />

As `usePropsEditor` and `PropsEditor` is rendered by you in the example, it is up to you to decide how you want to compose them for your use case.

For instance, you can place the `<PropsEditor />` above your example if that make sense, or adding additional props/state that you doesn't want the `usePropsEditor` to manage.

## Overwriting Initial Props

By passing `initialProps` options to `usePropsEditor`, you can overwrite the initial values for props in the playground.

<PlaygroundSource2 />

<PlaygroundResult2 />

## Adding/Overwriting Control

By default, `usePropsEditor` will try to infer the control for you based on the props definition. However, we will not infer the props control for the following conditions:

1. props that are not primitive. For instance, you may have a complex object as props, which is impossible to provide a sensible default.
1. props that comes from `@types/react`. If we include those, it will be a giant list of controls.

However, you can add those manually by passing `controls` options to `usePropsEditor`.

<ControlOptionsSource />

<ControlOptionsResult />

`controls` options is a key-value object where the key is the prop, and the value is the configuration of the control.

1. Currently, we support 4 types of control, `select`, `textinput`, `checkbox`, and `object`. Except for `select`, you can provide the config as string (`textinput`) or as an object (`{ type: 'textinput' }`).
1. For `select`, you must provide the `options`, which is an Array of `{ label: string; value: any }`. The value can be anything, including JSX.
