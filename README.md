# react-compdoc

- [x] get component props data and render example `.mdx` with MDX.
- [x] live example that is editable
- [x] load custom CSS
- [x] customize webpack plugin
- [x] build static output
- [x] tweak design
- [x] show all components in sidebar
- [x] precompile snippet example
- [x] pre-rendering
- [ ] configure sidebar structure (including supporting arbitrary mdx file)
- [ ] allow search components in sidebar

Something like `react-styleguidist`, but use MDX for example and `esbuild` for playground so you can have example in TypeScript.
